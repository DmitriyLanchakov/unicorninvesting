#Forex workflow

1. Forex symbols in symbols list
2. output nodes represent % allocation on each currency
3. USD is base currency
4. input nodes are conversion rates of currency pairlists
5. fitness function will need to be in base USD
    a. General workflow of NN Performance eval
        for each output set
        start with USD 100%
        convert X percent into the other currencies based off of conversion rates provided in the first record
        for each subsequent record
            adjust percent allocations accordingly
            pull 10% out of USD and add to running total of return
        On final data record, convert all currencies to USD, add to running total of return  
        Return the running total of the return as the performance.
        
        
        fitness functions to use:
 
 
1)    Profit x Winners / Drawdown
 
Winners = %Prof x TotalTrades
 
% Profitable -  The percentage of profitable trades.
Total Trades - The total number of trades that were generated by the strategy.
 
 
NP x NP x NP x Winners / (DD x DD)
 
Maximizing NetProfit
Maximizing # Winners
Minimizing Drawdown
 
NP: NetProfit -  How much a strategy made or lost.
DD: Drawdown
 
 
Fitness = NP*NP*NP*Winners/(DD*DD)
If TotalTrades<1000 then Fitness := Fitness * 0.5
 
 
 
2)    PPC: Perfect Profit Correlation 
 
Calculates the correlation of the actual equity curve vs. a "perfect" curve as if the strategy was able to buy every bottom and sell every top. The genetic optimizer will target an equity curve, that closely matches a "perfect" equity curve.
 
Fitness = NP x PPC / DD
